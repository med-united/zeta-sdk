/**
* Aggregates all configurations required to build and initialize the SDK's HTTP client.
*
* This class is **mutable during configuration time** and typically consumed by a higher-level
* builder (e.g., `Client { … }`). After the client is built, instances should be treated as
* effectively immutable and not reused concurrently.
*
* ### Configuration style
* - `baseUrl("https://...")` sets a hard override for the service base URL.
* - `network { … }`, `security { … }`, `monitoring { … }` each receive the **current** config
*   instance and must **return** the updated instance. This supports immutable config types
*   (e.g., data classes using `copy(...)`).
* - `engine { … }` lets you provide a platform-specific `HttpClientEngine` **factory** that will
*   be invoked lazily by the client builder; `engine(engine)` pins a concrete instance.
*
